<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Sathya RS, a final-year student from Kannampalayam, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, with a strong passion for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision. I specialize in building intelligent systems that address real-world challenges, particularly in the field of gesture recognition for individuals with speech disabilities. My recent work focuses on real-time hand gesture recognition using MediaPipe and custom-trained ML models to interpret and vocalize common signs like “hi,” “bye,” and “thank you.” I believe technology should be inclusive and accessible, and I strive to create solutions that make a meaningful impact. In addition to my technical interests, I enjoy drawing, painting, and craftwork, which fuels my creativity and problem-solving mindset..</p>
